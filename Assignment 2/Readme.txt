Project: COMP3314 Assignment 2 
Contributors: Lohia Suyash (3035550406) & Gupta Aditya (3035662297)

Platform Developed on: Jupyter Notebook 
Language Used: Python3 
Libraries Installed: [pandas, torch, torch.optim, torchvision, adabelief_pytorch]

In this project we have submitted an .ipynb file (which can be run on jupyter notebook) & .py file (run using any python compiler).

Below are the steps to run our program. 

1. Make sure that Python3.x is being used to run the programs
2. Make sure that all python packages/libraries are installed. If not installed you can simply install by running the commands:
    - pip3 install pandas
    - pip3 install torch 
    - pip3 install adabelief-pytorch==0.2.0

3. Make sure that you have jupyter notebook installed on your system
4. Open the directory containing the .ipynb file 
5. Enter the command "jupyter notebook". A web browser shall pop up, click on the .ipynb file to open it, click on 'Cell' on the menu, and lastly 'Run All'. 

If you are not using Jupyter notebook to run the program, you could simply run the .py file using any python compiler. 
This could be done by simply repeating setp 1 & 2, followed by entering "python3 main.py" once you're in the same directory as the file on the terminal. 

All features/ requirements have been implemented properly. Please feel free to contact us in case there is any difficulty in running our code through suyash@connect.hku adityag@connect.hku.hk 
We shall be happy to guide you through it!
